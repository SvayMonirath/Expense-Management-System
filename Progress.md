# Java Backend Project Progress
---

## Week 1 – Basic Java
**Objective:** Learn Java syntax and fundamental programming concepts.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Know how to do basic coding with Java
- Understand conditional statements and loops

**Activities Completed:**
- [x] Learned Java syntax (classes, methods, variables)
- [x] Practiced primitive and reference data types
- [x] Practiced control structures: if/else, switch, for/while loops
- [x] Worked with basic I/O using Scanner and System.out.println
- [x] Applied basics in small exercises

---

## Week 2 – Class & Object I
**Objective:** Understand and implement classes, objects, and methods.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understand how to define and use classes
- Understand method overloading
- Begin applying OOP principles to a project

**Activities Completed:**
- [x] Created model classes: `User`, `Transaction`, `Expense`, `Income`
- [x] Implemented constructors with input validation
- [x] Used private fields and getters (encapsulation)
- [x] Added methods: `addTransaction()`, `showTransactions()`
- [x] Stored multiple transactions using ArrayList
- [x] Practiced method overloading where needed

## Week 3 – Class & Object II
**Objective:** Understand references vs value types, static members, and continue project development.

**Activities Planned:**
- [ ] Understand the difference between reference and value types
- [ ] Understand static variables and methods
- [ ] Continue project development with previous classes
- [ ] Hands-on practice and individual assignments

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Improved understanding of memory management in Java
- Able to implement static methods for shared functionality

---

## Week 4 – Access Control (Encapsulation)
**Objective:** Apply access control, method overloading, package management, and use Java API for data structures.

**Activities Planned:**
- [ ] Learn and apply access modifiers (private, protected, public)
- [ ] Overload methods where applicable
- [ ] Create packages and organize project classes
- [ ] Explore Java API packages (Collections, Lists, Maps)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Project classes become modular and well-encapsulated
- Efficient use of Java data structures in the project

---

## Week 5 – Interface & Abstract Method
**Objective:** Learn interfaces and abstract classes and apply them in the project.

**Activities Planned:**
- [ ] Implement interfaces in the project
- [ ] Use abstract methods correctly
- [ ] Practice overriding methods from interfaces/abstract classes

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Understand and apply polymorphism through interfaces and abstract methods
- Project design becomes more flexible and modular

---

## Week 6 – Inheritance
**Objective:** Understand inheritance, polymorphism, overriding, and Object methods like equals() and toString().

**Activities Planned:**
- [ ] Implement inheritance and method overriding
- [ ] Understand polymorphism with parent and child classes
- [ ] Apply equals() and toString() for better object handling

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Project structure uses inheritance effectively
- Code reuse and polymorphic behavior implemented

---

## Week 7 – Exception, File I/O, & Thread
**Objective:** Handle exceptions, CRUD operations with files, and basic multithreading.

**Activities Planned:**
- [ ] Handle exceptions gracefully
- [ ] Create custom exception classes for user guidance
- [ ] Perform file read/write (CRUD) operations
- [ ] Use threads to perform synchronized tasks

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Robust project that handles runtime errors
- Ability to persist project data and use threads

---

## Week 8 – Other Inheritance
**Objective:** Learn advanced OOP concepts: anonymous inner classes, functional interfaces, lambda expressions.

**Activities Planned:**
- [ ] Use anonymous inner classes in the project
- [ ] Implement functional interfaces
- [ ] Apply lambda expressions where appropriate

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Cleaner, more modern Java code
- Understanding of advanced OOP features for future projects

---

## Week 9 – GUI
**Objective:** Learn and apply GUI in Java programming.

**Activities Planned:**
- [ ] Design GUI for the project (Swing/JavaFX)
- [ ] Connect GUI with project backend classes

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Project becomes interactive with a user-friendly interface
- Able to present a working Java GUI project

---

## Week 10 – Final / Presentation
**Objective:** Present the completed project.

**Activities Planned:**
- [ ] Prepare project for presentation
- [ ] Present project with explanation of features, design, and code
- [ ] Demonstrate understanding of Java OOP concepts

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Demonstrate synthesis of learning
- Develop presentation and communication skills
- Reflect on overall learning experience
